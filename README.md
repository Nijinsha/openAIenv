# openAIenv : Solving openAI gym environment with mulitple Reinforcement learning algorithm

## Introduction

For this repo, I have used multiple algorithm and I try to solve most gym based environment using them. 
For every project, I have also added a video on how the agent behaves after the training is complete. I have also added a 
simple explanation for each algorithm on their page.
